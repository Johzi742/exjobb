# # Useful links, tutorials, and reads when starting a Bioinformatics project #
# 
# This simple page contain links to various sources that are good to know before and during a Bioinformatics project. It is written in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) which is a notebook system that enables you to write code, run it and document it in an iteractive environment. It is strongly suggested that you use it.
# 
# 
# ### Setup ###
# 
# 1. Create a SNIC user at https://supr.snic.se/person/register/new/? this will allow you
# access to the SuperComputing Resources available to the
# group. Currently, around 300,000 core hours/month.
# 
#     * When you have gotten the SUPR account apply to membership in all the projects: https://supr.snic.se/project/request/?search=wallner
#     *
# 
# 2. Create a [github](http://github.com) account. Git is a version control system that enable you to keep track of changes to your code. No more: script.py, script_new.py, scrip_new2.py etc. Github is a cloud-based service that facilities the distribution and sharing of the code. The idea is that you should use git for your project, t

#     * [10 minutes quick start to github] https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
#     
# 3. Create a 'new repository' in your github account named 'exjobb'
#     * Choose to import from another repository
#         * use the link https://github.com/bjornwallner/exjobb to import some initial files for you exjobb.
#     * Copy the url of your newly created repo, e.g https://github.com/[REPLACE_WITH_GITHUB_USER]/exjobb and send it to bjornw_AT_ifm.liu.se
# 
# 4. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) choose the Python 2.7 version. This will install a special version of Python that includes the Jupyter Notebook and basically all Python modules needed (deep-learning modules that has to be installed separately)
# 
# 5. Familiarize with [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) using the following tutorial: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook. 
# 
# 6. Creating your first 'exjobb' files:  
# 
#   * In a terminal you can make a local copy of your `exjobb` repo in github by the command: 
# ```
#     git clone https://github.com/[REPLACE_WITH_GITHUB_USER]/exjobb
# ```
#    This will download the contents of `exjobb` repo to the folder `exjobb/`
#     * Change the folder: `cd exjobb`
#     * Start the notebook with the following command: `jupyter notebook wiki.ipynb`, which will open the notebook for this current document.
#     * You can use this notebook to play around with what you can do. This is actually a good way to learn python interactively (See Jupyter heading below) 
#         
#     * When you have created new files that you want to add to the version control you can do `git add <filename>` or `git add *` do put them under version control by git.
#     * `git commit -a -m 'Initial commit'` will add the current changes to the repo with the message 'Initial commit'.
#     * `git push` will upload all the changes to github. You can go to https://github.com/[REPLACE_WITH_GITHUB_USER]/exjobb to check that it worked.

# ### Python ###
# 
# 
# 
# We are still using Python 2, mostly because it works and we have not seen any reason to move to Python 3. These quite old articles still hold:
# 
# * https://learntocodewith.me/programming/python/python-2-vs-python-3/
# * http://blog.thezerobit.com/2014/05/25/python-3-is-killing-python.html
# 
# Code Academy is good place to learn python interactively. 
# 
# * https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python
# 
# We can also recommend the Google Python Class that contains Videos lectures as well.
# 
# * https://developers.google.com/edu/python/
# 
# 
# ###  Python modules ###
# 
# Here is a list of the most common modules we are using. They can be installed using for instance `pip`, but if you have installed Anaconda, you will have gotten most packages installed already, including the ones below.
# 
# ```
# pip install scipy
# pip install scikit-learn
# pip install seaborn
# 
# ```
# 
# [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org) (pronounced “Sigh Pie”) contains these core packages:
# 
# * NumPy - Base N-dimensional array package
# * SciPy library - Fundamental library for scientific computing
# * Matplotlib - Comprehensive 2D Plotting
# * IPython - Enhanced Interactive Console
# * pandas - Data structures & analysis
# 
# 
# [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) is the package we use to do machine learning.
# 
# [scikit-learn tutorials](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html) contains an introduction to scikit-learn. 
# 
# [keras](http://keras.io) is the package we use for deep-learning (This is not part of anaconda)
# 
# [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) is used to produce publication grade plots with minimal effort.
# 
# 

# 
# ### Jupyter ###
# [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) is a notebook system that enables you to write code, run it and document it in an iteractive environment. It is strongly suggested that you use it.
# 
# https://svds.com/jupyter-notebook-best-practices-for-data-science/
# 
# #### securing the notebook ####
# 
# If you are running the notebook on a shared system, such as NSC. It is good that you secure it using a password and turn on encryption (https). Below is an extract from http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html#notebook-server-security on how to do that.
# 
# First generate a config file you do not already have one.
# ```
# jupyter notebook --generate-config
# 
# ```
# Prepare a hashed password using the following code:

# In[ ]:

from notebook.auth import passwd
passwd()


# #### making .py and .html conversion automatically when saving the notebook 
# 
# Reference: https://svds.com/jupyter-notebook-best-practices-for-data-science/
# 
# Put the following at the top of `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file:
# 
# ``` python
# import os
# from subprocess import check_call
# 
# def post_save(model, os_path, contents_manager):
#     """post-save hook for converting notebooks to .py scripts"""
#     if model['type'] != 'notebook':
#         return # only do this for notebooks
#     d, fname = os.path.split(os_path)
#     check_call(['jupyter', 'nbconvert', '--to', 'script', fname], cwd=d)
#     check_call(['jupyter', 'nbconvert', '--to', 'html', fname], cwd=d)
# 
# c.FileContentsManager.post_save_hook = post_save
# ```

# # InterComp for Small-Molecule Ligands #
# 
# Adapt [InterComp](https://doi.org/10.1101/235812) for comparison of small-molcule ligands.
# 
# This includes:
# 
#     * Assessing statistical significance for small-molcule comparisons
#     * Chemical similarity
#     * Benchmark against similar software LIGSIFT
# 
# Similar software is described here:
